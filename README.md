<h1> Project Overview </h1>

<p> This repository contains my Major Practical Project, a data-driven journalism feature titled “Journalist deaths hit record levels amid surge in global conflicts.” </p>

<p> The project investigates and visualises the killing of journalists worldwide between 1992 and 2024, with a particular focus on conflict and war zones. Using verified datasets and interactive visualisation, the feature explores long-term trends, geographic distribution, and the increasing risks faced by journalists reporting from areas affected by war. </p>
