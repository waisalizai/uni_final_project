# For the Major Practical Major Project module, I created a data-driven feature entitled “Journalist deaths hit record levels amid surge in global conflicts”. The piece incorporates charts produced with R programming software, interactive visualisation in D3.js, and maps built with Leaflet and D3. All these interactive visualisations and map illustrate and analyse journalist deaths that occurred from 1992 to 2024 worldwide, with a focus on deaths in war zones.
