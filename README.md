# Project Overview

This repository contains my Major Practical Project, a data-driven journalism feature titled “Journalist deaths hit record levels amid surge in global conflicts.”

The project investigates and visualises the killing of journalists worldwide between 1992 and 2024, with a particular focus on conflict and war zones. Using verified datasets and interactive visualisation, the feature explores long-term trends, geographic distribution, and the increasing risks faced by journalists reporting from areas affected by war.

## Data and Methodology

- Primary data source: Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ)

### Data cleaned, structured, and analysed using:

- Python (Pandas)

- SQL

- R

- Excel

Note: Only CPJ-defined confirmed work-related deaths are included in core analyses, in line with CPJ methodology.

Methodological choices were guided by journalistic standards of accuracy, transparency, and reproducibility.

Visualisations

The feature includes:

Statistical charts built in R to analyse trends over time

Interactive D3.js visualisations for comparative and temporal analysis

Geospatial maps built with Leaflet and D3 to show country-level and regional patterns

All visualisations are designed to support editorial storytelling and allow readers to explore the data interactively.
